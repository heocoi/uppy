After the 2.0 release we’ve been busy refactoring, updating dependencies, moving from npm to Yarn 3 and much-needed housekeeping. We’ve also released a new Audio plugin, improved Status Bar and Unsplash

<!--more-->

## Audio plugin

Uppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, messages and sounds. Check it out [on the demo page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## Status bar error state improvements

Status bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we’ve addressed that:

* Error state is shown if only _one_ failed file instead of _all_ failed files. Used to be stuck in the uploading state when a file failed.
* Added “x of x files uploaded” below “Upload failed” for extra context.
* Improved the error details button styling in the statusbar and the file info card.
* Status bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed files.

PR [#3299](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3299).

## `@uppy/unsplash` is now production ready

The Unsplash plugin has received an update to its UI, it now shows the author of an image, and generally looks better. You can view the [docs on the website](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).

PR [#3196](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3196).

## Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs

This is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a separate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in the class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add/remove new locale strings.

See PR [#3276](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3276) for details.

## Yarn v3 instead of npm

We’ve switched the uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance — with our complex dependency graph and over 30 packages in a monorepo, we are seeing a speed increase of over a few minutes!

We are using Corepack to make sure all Uppy contributors are using the same version of Yarn. If you are an Uppy contributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:

```sh
corepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed
yarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed
yarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn
```

See details in [#3237](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3237)

## Misc

* @uppy/google-drive: plugin has been updated for brand compliance (#3178)
* @uppy/status-bar: now shows all details on mobile when `showProgressDetails` is `true` (#3174)
* @uppy/core: move `Uppy` class to its own module (#3225)
* @uppy/angular: fix component crash by loosening `package.json` version constraints (#3210)
* @uppy/drop-target: Exposed events (#3238)

## Companion

### Simultaneous upload/download #3159

This removes the need for disk space as data will be buffered in memory and backpressure will be respected. This is especially useful for large files (multi-GB).

**NOTE:** This is turned off by default (`streamingUpload` / `COMPANION_STREAMING_UPLOAD` option). Do not turn on yet if using TUS for uploads, due to [this tus-js-client bug](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275)

### Misc

- Make @uppy/unsplash production ready #3196
- Add `maxFileSize` option in companion for safety #3159
- New AWS S3 multipart presigned URL batching endpoint #3056
- Improve CORS default headers #3167
- Use GET instead of HEAD for `getURLMeta` for better server compatibility (especially signed S3 URLs) #3048
- Sort Google Drive list by name #3069
- Deprecate missing `uploadUrls` option (will be required in the future) #3182
- Close window on auth callback error and show error to user #3143
- Cut off length of file names to avoid AWS error #3048
- Safely escape `<script>` injected code in companion send-token.js #3101
- Upgrade aws-sdk #3334
- Improve logging #3103
- Change Provider/SearchProvider API to async and use streams instead #3159
