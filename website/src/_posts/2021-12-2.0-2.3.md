## Audio plugin

Uppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, messages and sounds. Check it out [on the demo page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## Status bar error state improvements

Status bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we’ve addressed that:

* Error state is shown if only _one_ failed file instead of _all_ failed files. Used to be stuck in the uploading state when a file failed.
* Added “x of x files uploaded” below “Upload failed” for extra context.
* Improved the error details button styling in the statusbar and the file info card.
* Status bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed files.

PR [#3299](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3299).

## `@uppy/unsplash` is now production ready

The Unsplash plugin has been refactored to make it brand compliant, show author of image in UI, improve maintainability and fix bugs. We’ve also finally added [docs to the website](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).

PR [#3196](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3196).

## Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs

This is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a separate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in the class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add/remove new locale strings.

See PR [#3276](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3276) for details.

## Yarn v3 instead of npm

We’ve switched the uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance — with our complex dependency graph and over 30 packages in a monorepo, we are seeing a speed increase of over a few minutes!

If you are an Uppy contributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:

Get started with the following commands:

```sh
corepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed
yarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed
yarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn
```

See details in [#3237](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3237)
