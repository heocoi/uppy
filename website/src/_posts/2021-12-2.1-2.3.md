After the [release](./2021-08-2.0.md) of our latest major version, 2.0.0, we’ve been busy with a number of things. First of all the long awaited audio plugin to record and upload live audio directly. We also worked on adding a fast and efficient streaming interface to Companion and made Unsplash production-ready. Lastly, we focused on  housekeeping, such as status bar improvements, moving from NPM to Yarn 3, refactoring, and updating dependencies.

## Audio plugin

Uppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, messages and sounds. Check it out [on the demo page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## `@uppy/unsplash` is now production ready

The Unsplash plugin has received an update, it provides attribution to the image authors, and adds some polish to make it look better. You can view the [docs on the website](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).

PR [#3196](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3196).

## Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs

This is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a separate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in the class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add/remove new locale strings.

See PR [#3276](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3276) for details.

## Status bar error state improvements

Status bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we’ve addressed that:

* Error state is shown if only _one_ failed file instead of _all_ failed files. Used to be stuck in the uploading state when a file failed.
* Added “x of x files uploaded” below “Upload failed” for extra context.
* Improved the error details button styling in the statusbar and the file info card.
* Status bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed files.

PR [#3299](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3299).

## Yarn v3 instead of npm

We’ve switched the uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance — with our complex dependency graph and over 30 packages in a monorepo, we are seeing a speed increase of over a few minutes!

We are using Corepack to make sure all Uppy contributors are using the same version of Yarn. If you are an Uppy contributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:

```sh
corepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed
yarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed
yarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn
```

See details in [#3237](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3237)

## Misc

## Companion

### Simultaneous upload/download #3159

This removes the need for disk space as data will be buffered in memory and backpressure will be respected. This is especially useful for large files (multi-GB).

**NOTE:** This is turned off by default (`streamingUpload` / `COMPANION_STREAMING_UPLOAD` option). Do not turn on yet if using TUS for uploads, due to [this tus-js-client bug](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275)
